# 99 (Ninety-Nine)
This repository contains my solutions to the classic 99 (Ninety-Nine) Prolog problems all in SWI-Prolog.

Problems can be found here: http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/

Simply run the SWI interpreter, `consult` the `99.pl` file and you're ready to go!

Note: all predicates are prefixed with `m_` to avoid collisions with the standard library.

( Still under progress, feel free to contribute solutions :) )
